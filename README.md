At launch, all balls in motion.

Upon first mouse click,
- ball is born at click location
- this ball starts expanding until it reaches threshold size
- at which point it begins shrinking, until its radius reaches 0, at which point it dies

If any other roaming ball comes into contact with a growing or shrinking ball
- it stops moving
- and starts the grow/shrink process

Example run
